"Skeleton Module Configuration data needed upgrading. Your old "
"configuration<br> has been wiped and a new set of defaults initialized. "
"This<br>will happen regularly during development, so don't report a<br>bug. "
"This simply means the module needs new configuration<br>data by default for "
"usable functionality that your old<br>configuration simply lacks. This new "
"set of defaults will fix<br>that by adding it in. You can re-configure "
"things now to your<br>liking. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br>"

"module was running. This is bad and<br>as a precaution your configuration "
"has been now restored to<br>defaults. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br>"
